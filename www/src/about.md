YAMLScript is a new programming language that uses YAML as its syntax.
It is a complete, functional, general purpose language, but can also be easily
embedded in YAML files to make them dynamic at load time.
Most existing YAML files and all JSON files are already valid YAMLScript
programs.
YAMLScript has a compiler/interpreter CLI program called `ys` and will soon be
available as a `libyamlscript.so` binding module in 42 programming languages.

YAMLScript has [usable releases](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases)
that you can install with:

```bash
$ curl https://yamlscript.org/install | PREFIX=~/.local bash
```

**YAMLScript is a Work In Progress.**
A stable release is not yet available, but is planned for early 2024.
Everything is subject to change at this point.
Stable releases will always remain backwards compatible.
